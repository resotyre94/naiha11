          "correctAnswer": "The poem 'A Photograph' by Shirley Toulson reflects on the themes of loss, memory, and the transience of life. The poet looks at an old photograph of her mother's childhood sea holiday and reminisces about her mother's laughter. After her mother's death, the photograph becomes a poignant reminder of her loss. The poem beautifully captures the contrast between the permanence of the sea and the fleeting nature of human life."
